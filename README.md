# Cobweb-Economy
Simulation of a cobweb economy
## Overview
- A simulation of an agricultural cobweb model where farmers predict future prices based on different forecasting rules.
- Incorporates positive and negative feedback economies to observe price dynamics.
- Data visualizations generated using `seaborn` to analyze trends and behaviors.

## Features
- **Farmers:** Adaptive, naive, and trend-following prediction strategies.
- **Economies:** Simulations for both positive and negative feedback economies.
- **DataFrames:** Stores prices and individual farmer predictions for detailed analysis.
- **Plots:** Visualizes price trends and predictions using `seaborn`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Define farmers and market parameters.
2. Run the `CobwebEconomy` simulation for desired feedback type.
3. Generate DataFrames for detailed results.
4. Visualize price and prediction trends.

## Key Outputs
- DataFrames with price history and individual farmer predictions.
- Line plots showcasing price trends for different feedback types.
- Comparison of farmer prediction accuracy and behavior.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository and install required libraries.
- Configure the `CobwebEconomy` class with custom farmers and market rules.
- Run the simulation and analyze results.
